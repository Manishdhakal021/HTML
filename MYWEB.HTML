Premature premonition, showin' me the demolition

Carpenter and Roan join the elite club of artists who have been nominated in all of the Big Four categories, with both vying for best new artist plus album of the year (Short n’ Sweet and The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, respectively), record of the year (Carpenter’s “Espresso” and Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!”) and song of the year (Carpenter’s “Please Please Please” vs. “Good Luck, Babe!”).
