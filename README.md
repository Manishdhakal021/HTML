This repository contains the first version of my HTML project dedicated to daily hip-hop updates. The page is built just for practice, but it showcases how hip-hop content can be styled and presented on the web. You’re free to use these codes and customize the content however you like I originally made it as a simple hip-hop themed page to practice my skills. As I keep learning, I’ll continue updating and improving the layout, features, and overall design.
